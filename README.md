# Hi there, I'm Richard 👋 👨‍💻
I'm an engineering lead currently working at <a href='https://wise.com'>Wise</a>. I am passionate about design systems and accessibility. I love delving into the world of creating impactful systems that scale for the developers, designers and for those who consume the UI. I love working with CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, ReactJS and most recently Web Components + StencilJS.
